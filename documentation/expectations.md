# Expectations


1. Fast

I was willing to wait over a night to get my results, or even
wait over a weekend but not a week or a month to be able to find
the status. 

2. Trust

As a result, I was willing to make some trade-offs
for accuracy: accept a small number of "false negatives" which
means "packages reported as broken but aren't" and preferably
a smaller number of "false positives" in means of "things reported
as working but actually not".

3. Simple

To avoid God's unknown way of interpretation of results,
I just wanted to "keep it simple" and do only one task: installation test
So the test is going to answer to the question:
"Does it install?". If it installs, it probably going to work, but
this not my intention to test in this project.
